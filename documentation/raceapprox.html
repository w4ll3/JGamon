Because  of the apparant sigmoid nature of this (empirically gained) distribution, an  approximation was assumed to be of the form  <img src="sigmoid.gif" width=117 height=36 alt="" border=0 style="vertical-align:middle;">, <i>d</i> denoting the difference in the needed throws.   <p>Linear regression for a funtion <i>f(d) = ad+b</i> resulted in the shown graph, which is already a good approximation. The mean square error of a random sample of another 1000 positions was 0.0024.</p>  <p>The values: a = 1.3, b = -0.65</p>  <p>As it is player 1's move, <i>p(0) =c .657 > .5</i> even at equal estimated rounds, player12 is more likely to win the game than player 2.</p> <h2>Race condition</h2> <p> If the positions taken into consideration are not limited to bear off boards, but to "separated" (no more hits possible) boards, the relationship above does no longer hold so well.</p> <p>The problem is that with growing distance to the end of the game the  the distribution of winning is less "sharp" over the difference of estimated rounds, more tending towards &frac12;.</p>  <p>Put into diagrams, the probability is as follows:<br><a href="prob2d.png"><img src="prob2d.png" width=401 height=300 alt=""></a><br><a href="contourprob.png"><img src="contourprob.png" width=401 height=300 alt=""></a><br><a href="variousprob.png"><img src="variousprob.png" width=401 height=300 alt=""></a></p> <p>It is obvious that in general the function is stillsigmoid but depends on two variables (player 1's moves to finish and player 2's moves to finish): <img src="sigmoid2.gif" width=146 height=36 alt="" border=0 style="vertical-align:middle;"></p><p>Linear regression for a funtion <i>f(x,y)</i> with the following functions:<i>x, y, xy, x&sup2;, y&sup2;, x<sup>-</sup>&sup1;, y<sup>-</sup>&sup1;</i> leadfinally to the resulting approximation of<div align="center"><i>f(x,y) = [-0.0315    0.0230    3.5864    1.3112   -1.0800   -5.6852][x^2 y^2 x/y x y 1]'</i></div><P>Theoretically it should be something with <i>1/(x-y)</i>, but numerically this was not appliable. The mean square error is 0.0025 </P>  </body></html>
